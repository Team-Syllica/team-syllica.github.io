# Install Guide
This is a guide on how to install maps for Minecraft: Java Edition. Much of this information was sourced from [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Map_downloads) and [Minecraft Maps](https://www.minecraftmaps.com/how-to-install-minecraft-maps).

## 1. Locate your Minecraft saves folder
Your Minecraft folder is located in a different place depending on your operating system. 

|    OS   |                  Location                 |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/.minecraft`                    |
|  MacOS  | `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` |
|  Linux  | `~/.minecraft`                            |

Open the `saves` directory inside this folder. You'll notice all of your other worlds are here.

## 2. Unzip your map file
Use your computer's built-in archive extractor or a program such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to open your world file. Move the folder inside to your saves folder.

Make sure that the world's `level.dat` file is in the top level of the world folder, or Minecraft won't recognize the world. 

## 3. Enjoy!
Open up Minecraft and enjoy your freshly installed map. You may have to restart the game if it doesn't appear immediately.
