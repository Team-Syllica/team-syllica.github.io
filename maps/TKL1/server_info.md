# Server Information
The Kitatcho Laboratories: Chapter 1 is a single-player experience and was not intended for multiple people. However, we recognize that people often like to play with friends! Here's a few tips you should know. 

In general, <span style="color: red;">**always treat challenges as a single-player experience**</span> for maximum enjoyment and avoiding exploits!

## Servers
- If you're playing Chapter 1 on a Vanilla server, make sure your `server.properties` file is set up properly
  - Command blocks are enabled
  - The difficulty is set to Normal (this will be changed in-game anyways)
  - Hardcore is off
  - Function permission level is 2
  - Spawn protection is off
  - View distance is set to 10 or more
  - Simulation distance is set to 6 or more
- Make sure your server is on the correct Minecraft version (this should be apparent on the map download page).
- Make sure you're not playing with any mods that change vanilla gameplay
- Everyone should have the resource pack installed. There's a download link in the map's setup instructions, and there should also be one available on this website.

## Multiplayer Best Practices
- The tools you pick up in the map cannot be transfered by throwing, so use chests to exchange who has which tools
- Always walk through doors together to avoid having one person be locked out of areas
- If one person dies, the other one should meet them at the spawn point to keep things fair
- **Always treat challenges as a single-player experience** for maximum enjoyment and avoiding exploits!
- In / around secret rooms, if the music is broken after you intend on leaving, one player can re-enter and exit the room to recalibrate the map's music
