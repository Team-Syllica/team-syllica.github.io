**Welcome to the Kitatcho Laboratories!**

Hello there, and welcome to the infamous Kitatcho Laboratories! You are TS-03. The third-ever test subject at this facility, and today you'll be making your way through 15 of the Kitatcho Laboratories High-Tech Puzzle Chambers!

These tests will range from placing slimeballs on pressure plates, bouncing off of slime blocks, using an electrical wrench with redstone, jumping with an added boost, swimming (sometimes through lava!), and even walking on sticky surfaces that contain substances that no one really knows what they are (It's best not to think about it)!

I hope you look forward to trying out our tests, and we hope to join you at the conclusion of the testing track for our Testers Reward Program, where we hand-crafted a reward built specifically for you!
