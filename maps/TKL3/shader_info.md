# Shader Information
People often like to play The Kitatcho Laboratories: Chapter 3 with shaders! However, keep in mind that the map was designed with vanilla lighting and textures in mind. The resource pack modifies most textures in the game, sometimes rebinding things in unexpected ways for shaders. Enable resource pack compatibility options in your shader settings to get the best experience!

We recommend [Complimentary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/) if you would like to play this map with shaders.
