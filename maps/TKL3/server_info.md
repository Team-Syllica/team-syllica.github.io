# Server Information
The Kitatcho Laboratories: Chapter 3 is a single-player experience and was not intended for multiple people. However, we recognize that people often like to play with friends and so have done our best to accomodate this in this release! Here's a few tips you should know. 

In general, <span style="color: red;">**always treat challenges as a single-player experience**</span> for maximum enjoyment and avoiding exploits!

## Servers
- If you're playing Chapter 3 on a Vanilla server, make sure your `server.properties` file is set up properly
  - Command blocks are enabled
  - The difficulty is set to Normal (this will be changed in-game anyways)
  - Hardcore is off
  - Function permission level is 2
  - Spawn protection is off
  - View distance is set to 10 or more
  - Simulation distance is set to 8 or more
- Make sure your server is on the correct Minecraft version (this should be apparent on the map download page).
- Make sure you're not playing with any mods that change vanilla gameplay. **Sodium mod is recommended client-size, and Lithium is acceptable server-side**.
- Everyone should have the resource pack installed. There's a download link in the map's setup instructions, and there should also be one available on this website.

## Multiplayer Best Practices
- You can throw the Kitatcho Electrical Wrench, Super-Legal Lockpick and Kitatcho Optical Lens in the map to transfer them to nearby friends!
  - Redstone will always go to the player holding the wrench
  - Levers will always go to the player holding the lockpick
  - These items still can't be used on pressure plates
- A copy of the Kitatcho Quality Bow will be given to both players, however only one arrow can exist at a time so as to not break any puzzles 
- Always walk through doors together to avoid having one person be locked out of areas
- If one person dies, the other one should meet them at the spawn point to keep things fair
- **Always treat challenges as a single-player experience** for maximum enjoyment and avoiding exploits!
- In / around secret rooms, if the music is broken after you intend on leaving, one player can re-enter and exit the room to recalibrate the map's music
