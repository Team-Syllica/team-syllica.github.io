Hey everyone!

The color complex is my first attempt at a parkour map. It features 7 levels with progressing difficulty, with some bonus challenges off the beaten path for some hidden diamonds (which are used for bragging rights only). The map also comes with a completely original soundtrack made by me, but don't worry for you YouTuber's out there as it's completely fine to play with no risk of demonetization!

Where it's my first attempt at a parkour map, it's nothing special and I can admit it's probably not perfect, but I hope you all enjoy it regardless. Feedback is highly appreciated!

Thanks again to everyone for the support and I hope you enjoy! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask me in my discord server that's linked in the hub of the map itself. Comments take a while to be approved on this site so discord is the best place to contact me for direct feedback/questions/etc.
