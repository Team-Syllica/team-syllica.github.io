# Multiplayer Notice

This map is made for both single-player and multiplayer. However, due to the way that Minecraft handles spawn points on servers, you might not spawn in the correct location when first joining. So make sure you teleport to the spawn coordinates at x:23 y:29 z:-16. 

Also, the resource pack is required for the map unless you want it to look and sound really ugly. So if you don't have the resource pack, you can download it here: [\[Click here to download\]](https://www.mediafire.com/file/v4xo17jjwkn7185/The_Color_Complex_-_Resources.zip/file)

The map should be fine with as many people as you'd like, but I think any more than 4-5 players will make things a bit cramped and chaotic (but maybe that'll lead to some fun, who knows)?
