        "description": "Since 2012, Stockley has been designing Minecraft maps, transforming what began as a hobby into a passion for creating immersive experiences. In 2018, he took things to the next level by founding Team Syllica, setting out to treat Minecraft maps as more than just gameplay spacesâ€”crafting them with the care and depth of standalone games.\n\nWith this focus on quality, Stockley has driven Team Syllica to new heights, most notably with the success of the Kitatcho Laboratories series. Along the way, he expanded his creative toolkit, developing skills in storytelling, pixel art for custom textures, and composing original music to bring each project to life. Through these efforts and the support of the community, Team Syllica continues to push boundaries, with many exciting new ideas on the horizon.",
